## DEBIAN-SETUP.TXT

This is a plain text file, designed to assist a user with initial setup of Debian Linux, or any/some/most distributions based on it.

I update this occasionally in accordance with the latest Debian repositories that may or may not include certain packages that are or aren't on STABLE or UNSTABLE. This list is designed for TESTING repositories.
Remove packages from "APT INSTALL" lines that aren't in your favourite repositories, suppliment manually.
